# javax-language
It is a repository for Javax programming language creation.  There is no such programming language.  We are planning to design the programming language called javax by a person who knows C programming.
In order to create the Javax programming language, you will not specify the Commands.  Commands will be created by owner, you can set parameters and other rules.
